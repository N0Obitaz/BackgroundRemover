I would like to aknowledge Python coding for sharing this tutorial


IMPORTANT NOTE!:
This python program is run in python version 3.8 only due to library specifically rembg is only available at that version. The library will not be installed in the latest python version. So make sure that you have python version 3.8 installed in your computer and configure its environment before installing the library and other dependencies.
